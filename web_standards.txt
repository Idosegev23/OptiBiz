The key web standards to keep in mind while writing code for web and mobile development include web browsers, HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side languages and frameworks, and web best practices such as cross-browser compatibility, responsive web design, performance, accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security. These standards are created by standards bodies such as the W3C and should be free to contribute and use without patent or licensing encumbrances. The phrase 'don't break the web' emphasizes that any new web technology introduced should be backwards and forwards compatible.
