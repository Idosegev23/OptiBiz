Best practices for load balancing and caching:

1. Place backends close to clients.
2. Enable caching with Cloud CDN.
3. Forwarding rule protocol selection.
4. Backend service protocol selection.
5. Recommended connection duration.
6. Balancing mode selection criteria.
7. Configure session affinity.
8. Distribute incoming requests across multiple servers or nodes using an appropriate type of load balancer and algorithm.
9. Store frequently used or expensive data in a suitable cache type and policy to reduce requests and improve response time.
10. Constantly monitor and optimize load balancing and caching using relevant metrics and tools.
11. Test and benchmark the system's performance under different workloads using load testing, stress testing, and soak testing with appropriate tools.
